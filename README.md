# Icons -  An Avatar the Last Airbender fan game.
This is my final project for a Media and Device architecture course, coded in C and artwork in masse found online but edited by me. In the game you play as various characters from Avatar the Last Airbender scattered around the world map, each on their way to reunite with the others.

### Running the Game
Run the Project.gba file to play!
